# World-Books

Book Search and Management Web Application

This project is a simple web application that allows users to search for books by title and manage a personalized Books list. Users can search for books using a search bar and view the search results in a paginated, filtered, and sorted format. The application provides features to add books to the Books list, edit book details, and offers a responsive layout for seamless usage across desktop and mobile devices.

The application utilizes React JS for the frontend development and incorporates Axios for making HTTP requests to the provided API endpoints. HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the user interface.

The backend API endpoints facilitate retrieving a list of books, adding books to the database, and updating book details. The GET request endpoint retrieves the existing books, while the POST request endpoint allows users to add new books to the database. The PUT request endpoint is used to modify book details by providing the book's unique ID.

By combining these technologies and libraries, this project aims to deliver a user-friendly and efficient book search and management experience, empowering users to easily search for books, create their personalized reading lists, and keep track of their favorite reads.
